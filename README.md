# Detailed-setting-of-uncertainty-
Three uncertainty levels are compared, as shown in the following.
Low: 
Wind power uncertainties follow a Weibull distribution. The scale and shape are set as [15, 5].
Load uncertainties follow a Gaussian distribution with mean values equaling the original loads and standard deviations equaling 3% of the means.
Medium: 
Wind power uncertainties follow a Weibull distribution. The scale and shape are set as [60, 4].
Load uncertainties follow a Gaussian distribution with mean values equaling the original loads and standard deviations equaling 7% of the means.
High:
Wind power uncertainties follow a Weibull distribution. The scale and shape are set as [100, 1].
Load uncertainties follow a Gaussian distribution with mean values equaling the original loads and standard deviations equaling 10% of the means.
The correlation coefficients of wind powers and loads are set as [0, 0], [0.3, 0], [0.7, 0.4], respectively.
